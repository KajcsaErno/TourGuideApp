# Tour Guide App
A multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about cities in my country.
The goal was to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city.  
The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.  
It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know.  
It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category.

## What I learned? ##
This project is about combining various ideas and skills I’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Planning my app design and navigation before coding
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Building layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer*
* Creating your own custom classes
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable)
* Navigation Drawers were not covered in this course, but you may choose to implement it in this app.

## Final result of my project - Romania Tour Guide
